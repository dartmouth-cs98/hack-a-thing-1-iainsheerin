Project for HackAThing

Description:
  - I attempted to build an iOS app where you could pick different types of strength exercises and favorite ones
      - would list what muscles were used and equipment needed
      - wanted to use SQLite/CoreData as way to store user data
         - In future update, I want the ability to track specific weights for each exercise

Who did what:
  - Solo Project: I did everything
  
What I learned:
  - I learned how to use Swift, specifcally swiftUI in Xcode 12
  - I learned that it is very complicated to use MongoDB and will not attempt to do so in the future
  - I learned how to create different views and buttons in SwiftUI
  - I learned how to integrate User Data in SwiftUI
  - I learned how to use Core Data / SQLLite with Swift
  - I learned how to create a list within SwiftUI
  - I learned about the changes from Xcode 11 to Xcode 12 and how the main function run file has changed between those versions
  - 

What didn't work:
  - I was not able to run MongoDB on my computer despite my attempts for 3+ hours
  - I was not able to use Core Data's Cloud kit to store data because I did not want to pay 100$ for the apple developer license
  - I was not able to figure out how to fully use SQLite/CoreData as a data storage for the iOS app
